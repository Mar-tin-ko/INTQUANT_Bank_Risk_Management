## INTQUANT: Advanced Topics in Bank Risk Management
This intensive two-weeks project is part of the international cooperation between University of Applied
Sciences bfi Vienna, University of Bologna, University of Economics in Katowice and Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași (UAIC). It was organized by the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration of UAIC Iași in cooperation with Banca Comercială Română (member of Erste Group) and was taught as a
combination of case study, lectures and tutorials offered by the local professors and distinguished guest experts from the banking sector. The topic of the course "Advanced Topics in Bank Risk Management" focused on the Development of Rating Models, took place in summer 2016 and it's successful completion was rewarded with 6 ECTS credits.

At the end of this course, the students are able to:
* Apply academic knowledge in a practical bank risk management context;
* Identify relevant theoretical coursework and translate it into solutions for
concrete bank risk management issues;

the field of banking;
* Work in an international team environment (3 students per team) and develop the ability to collaborate, to formulate and defend their point of view in a constructive manner;
* Prepare a realistic set of solutions to a bank risk management case study;
* Build a scorecard and use it for credit decision.

### Case Study
This GitHub repository stores my team's Project solution for INTQUANT: Advanced Topics in Bank Risk Management demonstrating the practical skills of development, calibration and validation of Credit Scorecards using R programming language. The cooperating bank has disclosed an anonymized sub-portfolio of applications of private individuals from the past. The key tasks of the Case Study include:
* to analyze the dataset (21,000 cases of applications), to select and transform the relevant variables appropriately;
* to develop rating model based on logistic regression that discriminates between clients that repay the loans and the ones that default within a one year time horizon;
* to assess the social impact and business perspective of the constructed Credit Scorecard model;
* to consider regulatory requirements regarding the validation by testing the robustness of the model assumptions and the accuracy of the model output;
* to code a well-designed and readable R script with proper model development documentation.

<br> My team succesfully completed all tasks of the Case Study and scored 81 points (ouf of 100).
